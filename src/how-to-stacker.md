# How to Participate as a Stacker (pre-Nakamoto)

Participating as a Stacker in the Stacks Blockchain is an essential role to ensure the liveliness of sBTC. To become a Stacker, you must hold and temporarily lock STX, Stacks’ native currency, and support the network’s security and consensus. As a reward, you earn BTC.

There are multiple ways for you to stack and earn Bitcoin - either [through an exchange](#stacking-through-an-exchange), a [non-custodial stacking service](#stacking-through-a-non-custodial-stacking-service), or [independently](#independent-stacking). The most appropriate choice depends on your crypto experience and the amount of STX you have at your disposal. For direct participation, Stacks holders need a dynamic minimum amount of STX (approximately 100,000k STX during the mainnet, but this amount fluctuates based on overall participation and supply. See the [`pox` endpoint](https://docs.hiro.so/api/get-proof-of-transfer-details) of the stacks node API to get the minimum of the next cycle). If you don't meet this minimum, you can still participate by leveraging third-party Stacking delegation services. These services combine your holdings with others, allowing joint participation. A complete breakdown of the stacking mechanism can be found in [SIP-007](https://github.com/stacksgov/sips/blob/main/sips/sip-007/sip-007-stacking-consensus.md).

Below is a documentation guide that outlines the steps to participate as a Stacker in the Stacks blockchain network, along with the responsibilities and actions involved in the role. Options for stacking through an exchange a stacking service can be found on the [stacks.co stacking page](https://www.stacks.co/learn/stacking#startstacking).
