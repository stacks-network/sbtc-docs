# Get Started with sBTC 0.1

The sBTC contract will be deployed on the Stacks testnet by an address that is still to be defined. See [sbtc/#178](https://github.com/stacks-network/sbtc/issues/178).

In sBTC 0.1, the deposit and withdrawal transactions are processed by a central authority (CA). The flow is as follows:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor AB as Alice-BTC
    participant CB as CA-BTC
    participant CS as CA-STX
    actor AS as Alice-STX
    CS ->> CS: deploys contract
    Note over AB, AS: BTC tx before contract deployment are ignored.
    loop
        AB ->> CB: sends BTC (deposit)
        CB ->> CS: processes BTC tx
        CS ->> AS: mints sBTC
    end
    loop
        AB ->> CB: sends dust (withdrawal request)
        CB ->> CS: processes BTC tx
        CS ->> AS: burns sBTC
        CB ->> AB: sends BTC (withdrawal fullfilment)
    end
```
