# Quickstart

If you are a developer looking to start building with sBTC, this is the place to start.

## 1. Familiarize yourself with sBTC

First, if you aren't familiar with what sBTC is or how it works, be sure to check out the [sBTC Design](./architecture) documentation.

## 2. Learn about the Developer Release

The [Developer Release](./sbtc-releases/sbtc-dev.md) is the very first version of sBTC, and is designed to provide a preview version of sBTC for developers to learn and experiment with.

## 3. Get setup with a local dev environment

Once you understand how it works and what the Developer Release is, it's time to get the sBTC development environment set up locally with the [Local Setup Guide](./local-setup.md).

## 4. Learn sBTC development

Now it's time to get up and running with a complete full-stack sBTC-powered application. The [End to End Tutorial](./tutorial.md) will teach you how to build an app using Next, Clarity, Stacks.js, and sBTC from start to finish.

## 5. Keep Going

Now that you've got the basics down, you can refer to the [deposit](./deposit.md) and [withdrawal](./withdrawal.md) code examples for a quick reference on how to initiate deposits and withdrawals with Stacks.js and the Leather wallet.
