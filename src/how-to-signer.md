# How to operate a signer

As a Stacker, you are responsible for ensuring the accuracy and integrity of incoming sBTC transactions. To satisfy this requirement and continue to earn BTC rewards, you must operate your own Signer or delegate your signing power to a third-party Signer. See the step-by-step guide to setting up and operating a Signer either by using the [default Signer implementation](./nakamoto-signer-developer-guide.md) or by [utilizing the Signer SDK](./nakamoto-signer-developer-guide.md#custom-signer-implementation).
